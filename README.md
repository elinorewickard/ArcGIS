# Overview

This project was a way to learn about using the ArcGIS library and create a map with unique markers.

When this software is run, it sould open on a webpage, centered over Idaho, U.S. and show markers over each of the counties. When a marker is clicked, it will show the population and license plate code for the county as is accurate in 2022.
